# Some Notes

The files in the `.SORT_ME` folder need to be analyzed and sorted out. Most of these I don't use anymore, but there is still useful info in them.

I also need to check out the files at:

> J:\Dropbox\VAULTS\JamesO2 Notes\TDL\TDL_Batch

I wrote a program to use SAXON to convert `.TDL` files using `XSL`. But I just use *XML Notepad* now because its easier and quicker. I don't really need these BATCH files anymore. Regardless, they're quite sophisticated, and there's something worth checking out there.

Also check out these Aseprite scripts I wrote here:

> J:\GitHub\Me-Private\CF2-MISC\SON\Batches

I need to sort through these too!
