# BAT batch files
 Some batch file scripts I made to help automate a bunch of processes.

Code by JamesO2.

Note to self: Right now I've only got a few Image conversion scripts, which rely on external Command Line programs to work.
In the future, I need to add some of my Aseprite Scripts, as well as the WinRAR scripts...
I should have a few more too, but I can't seem to find where I put them.

> Also, please sort through the scripts listed here:

# Complete Scripts
These scripts are finished, and are ready use to "out of the box."

## GIFsicle_Compress_DnD.bat - GifSicle Easy Drag-n-drop Compression
Let's you re-compress a GIF animation by simply dropping the file into the console window.  
Useful since Aseprite's GIF compression isn't super great.

Note: This script requires that you have GifSicle installed and properly setup as an Environment Variable.

# WIP Scripts
These scripts are not fully user-friendly, and need to be manually tinkered with to work.

## FFMPEG_GIF-to-MP4.bat
Convert's a GIF animation to MP4 video file.  
Still needs some work.

Note: This script requires FFMPEG to be installed and setup as an Environment Variable.

## ImageMagick_combine_png_to_GIF.bat
Convert's a folder full of PNGs into a GIF animation, using ImageMagick

Note: This script require's ImageMagick to be installed and setup as an Environment Variable.
